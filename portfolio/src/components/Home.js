                        I have been working in Web Development in some way ever since I got out of the Navy in 2009.

                    When I started I self taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS, so that I could create a website to show off my kids to my family.  As the years went on I learned more on my own.

                <p>
                    At the beginning of 2020 I started Lambda School to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  Please take a look at my current and past projects to see what I am doing and have done.
